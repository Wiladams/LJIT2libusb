# LJIT2libusb
LuaJIT binding to libusb

This binding can onbly be classified as "experimental" at the moment.

There already exists a complete lua/libusb binding here: https://github.com/radioflash/ljusb

If you actually want to be productive with lua and libusb, I would recommend using the radioflash binding.
